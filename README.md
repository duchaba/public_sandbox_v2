# public_sandbox_v2
These are experimental. It is for sharing with friends. It is a place where I share a snippet to further our conversation. If you stumble on this repository, you are free to read them, but please don’t ask questions about them. They are “as is.” The last "public sandbox" was closed because some people whose names were withheld did NOT understand the meaning of the words "public" and "friendship." Thus, this version is governed by the MIT License. 

# Note: 
If you have to ask, "Am I your friend?" then perhaps we are not friends.
